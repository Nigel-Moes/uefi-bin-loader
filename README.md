# uefi-bin-loader
This UEFI application for ARMv8-A and ARMv9-A architectures is based on the EDK II open source project. It takes a flat binary .bin file, loads it into memory and jumps to its entry point. The names of the .bin file and the entry point function can be specified in the file src/include/loader.h. For more information on building the application and documentation regarding EDK II see: https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
